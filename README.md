This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML where an event listener attached to a dynamically added element does not work as expected. The bug occurs because the event listener is attached to the element before it's added to the DOM. The solution involves adding the event listener after the element is appended to the DOM.  The files provided are `bug.html` which demonstrates the bug and `bugSolution.html` which provides the solution.
